The owner of a boarding house has ten rooms for rent for students,
these rooms are identified by the numbers 0 to 9.

When a student wants to rent a room, the name must be registered
and email of this student.

Make a program that starts with all ten empty rooms, and then
read a quantity N representing the number of students going
rent rooms (N can be from 1 to 10).

 Then record the rent of the N students. For each rental record, inform the name and email of the
student, as well as which of the rooms he chose (from 0 to 9).

Suppose a spare room is chosen. At the end, your program should print
a report of all occupations of the boarding house, in order of room,
as the example.
